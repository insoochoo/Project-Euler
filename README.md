Problems
------
#### #1 : Multiples of 3 and 5 #2: Even Fibonacci numbers
>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.

#### #2: Even Fibonacci numbers
>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,â‹¯

>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
